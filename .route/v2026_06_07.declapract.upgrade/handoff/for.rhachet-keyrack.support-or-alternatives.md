# handoff: keyrack support for 'or' alternatives in env declarations

## .what

keyrack.yml should support declaration that a key can be satisfied by an alternative envvar.

## .why

- OIDC auth sets `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` — NOT `AWS_PROFILE`
- keyrack.yml declares `AWS_PROFILE` under `env.all` for local development
- keyrack.source() in strict mode fails when AWS_PROFILE is absent, even if AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID is present
- if you set `AWS_PROFILE` alongside `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, AWS SDK prefers profile lookup, which fails

## .pattern

```yaml
env.all:
  - AWS_PROFILE | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID  # satisfied if either is present
```

or

```yaml
env.all:
  - key: AWS_PROFILE
    or: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
```

## .behavior

in strict mode, keyrack.source() should pass if ANY of the alternatives is present in process.env.
